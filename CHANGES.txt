1.0dev (unreleased)
-------------------

- Initial release
- Renamed to plone.app.themeeditor (was plone.app.skineditor) [pigeonflight]
- Added a link to the themeeditor in site actions via actions.xml [pigeonflight]
- Adjusted the html in console.pt as it did not validate 
   (a tag should not contain dt tag) [pigeonflight]
- updated css to work with the new structure of console.pt [pigeonflight]
- replaced the use of p tag with span for the resource descriptions
   p tags are not allowed within dd or dt tags [pigeonflight]
- appended a number from the tal repeat to the end of each resource id
   to ensure that all resource items get a unique id [pigeonflight]
- fixed code on zopeview.py, portlet.py and viewlet.py so that it works with
   older versions of customerize (i.e. initial fixes towards Plone 3
   compatibility) [pigeonflight]
- patched plone.app.customerize for performance if the version is older 1.1.3
  used collective.monkeypatcher
   (this should improve performance of theme editor on Plone 3) [pigeonflight]
- using collective.monkeypatcher preconditions parameter didn't seem to work 
    used a zcml:condition instead to select for Plone 3 and apply the patch
    [pigeonflight]
