Installation
============

If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

 * Add ``plone.app.themeeditor`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.::
    
    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        plone.app.themeeditor
  
 * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug::
   
    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        plone.app.themeeditor
  
 * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
   
   $ ./bin/buildout
        

Plone 3 notes
-------------

You will need to add the [plone3] "extra" to the egg entry
and pin newer versions of plone.app.customerize and plone.app.jquerytools 
shown below::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        plone.app.themeeditor [plone3]
    
    versions = versions

    [versions]
    plone.app.jquerytools = 1.1.2
    plone.app.customerize = 1.1.3
