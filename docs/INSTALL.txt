plone.app.themeeditor Installation
====================================
To install plone.app.themeeditor into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:


If you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

 * Add ``plone.app.themeeditor`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
 
    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        plone.app.themeeditor
        
  * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:
  
    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        plone.app.themeeditor
        
  * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
  
    $ ./bin/buildout
        

Plone 3 notes
--------------
Important information about the 'crossover release':

This release introduces two new contenttypes, which allows you to manual set the order of the items.
This order is introduced in the new contenttypes, not the old ones because this will break them and
all the data will be lost. This is the reason why new contenttypes are introduced.
If you want to migrate your categories and classifieds to the new contenttypes you have to
create a 'Classifieds (with order)' container and add 'Category (with order)' items there.
After that you can cut and paste the classifieds in the correct categories.
