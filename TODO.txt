Alpha 1:
- add support for viewlets and portlets
- handle nested skin items
- fix or at least find workaround for uploading files in popups
  - the jquery forms plugin looks promising for this. David G will tt Steve M about incorporating into plone.app.jquerytools
- put JS and CSS in separate files instead of inline in the templates
- register configlet
- add random salt to GET requests that shouldn't be cached, for IE
  - (first check to confirm if this is an issue)
- on popup close, update opened drawers rather than entire page
- option to show only customized resources
- fix lookup of layers for 2 views with the same name but different contexts

Research:
- warning on customizing something that has already been customized
  --> probably not needed, b/c it doesn't clobber an existing item
- drag-and-drop upload
- exporters
- fallback to unskinned main template
  - any way to detect when switching to Restricted Python is going to cause access problems?
- filter out known ZMI views unless overridden

Alpha 2:
- gloworm integration
- custom forms
  - filesystem page template: view, customize
  - filesystem image: view, customize
  - page template: view, edit, remove
  - image: view, edit, remove
- support showing resources for themes other than the active one
- implement z3c.jbot based customizations (need to figure out a way to detect and how
  jbot based customizations in the UI)
- possibly create a resource that type that can introspect z3c.jbot template
  override registry

Alpha 3:
- export customizations as a new theme 
- (based on conversation with davisagli) implement an export method for earch resource type
  the idea is to make it possible to iterate over each customized resourse using the 
  resource retreiever and export the result to the "export" directory
