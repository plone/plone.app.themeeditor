Alpha 1:
- tests
- viewlets and portlets
- handle nested skin items
- fix or at least find workaround for uploading files in popups
- put JS and CSS in separate files
- register configlet
- add random salt to GET requests that shouldn't be cached, for IE
- on popup close, update opened drawers rather than entire page

Research:
- warning on customizing something that has already been customized
- drag-and-drop upload
- exporters
- fallback to unskinned main template
  - any way to detect when switching to Restricted Python is going to cause access problems?
- filter out known ZMI views unless overridden

Alpha 2:
- gloworm integration
- custom forms
  - filesystem page template: view, customize
  - filesystem image: view, customize
  - page template: view, edit, remove
  - image: view, edit, remove
- support showing resources for themes other than the active one
